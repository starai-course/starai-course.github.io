We aim to explain essential Reinforcement Learning concepts such as value based methods using a fundamentally human tool - stories. We believe what you cannot create, you do not understand. We have provided easy to use exercises, with answers, to reinforce your learning.  \u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nMaximise Your Learning. To maximise your learning, we recommend you form a study group(s) in your local area and cover the course contents over a period of 6 weeks.\nFor inspiration, check out what we did last year here.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExercise Technology. All exercises are executed in Google Colaboratory and run \u0026ldquo;in browser\u0026rdquo; making them hardware independent. All you need is a Google account and either Firefox or Google Chrome Browsers.\n\u0026nbsp;\nHow to do the exercises. Watch the lecture material, then have an attempt at the exercises.\nWe highly recommend you only look at the answers after spending significant time trying to solve the exercise material.\n\u0026nbsp;\nEn Taro Adun! Way back in April 2018! -an actual epoch in the machine learning world!- we set out to create this course to help speed up the development of advanced machine learning techniques through a fun platform - mainly - Starcraft 2, hence the name \u0026ldquo;StarAi\u0026rdquo;.\nFor a long time Starcraft has been considered within the machine learning community to be the next \u0026ldquo;Grand Challenge\u0026rdquo; for Artificial Intelligence due to several properties of the game including very high state \u0026amp; action spaces, partial observability \u0026amp; multi agent gameplay.\nThis year Deepmind made significant progress with regards to solving the game. For all intents and purposes, removing the \u0026ldquo;human limitations\u0026rdquo; restrictions currently emposed on Deepmind\u0026rsquo;s system, the game can be said to be solved and am sure we will see even further progress towards the end of the year from Deepmind\u0026rsquo;s Starcraft team akin to AlphaGo Zero.\nWhy even release the course then? We still believe that the development of bots for games is a fun a way to learn advanced machine learning techniques \u0026amp; if your work in the field eventually leads to new breakthroughs, even more kudos to you!\nWe also believe that RL will have massive impact in the real world. That is the subject of the next section!\nFor those of you only interested in the Starcraft element of StarAi please refer to the content of week 6 by clicking this link.\n\u0026nbsp;\nReinforcement Learning in the Wild. Outside of games however, we are beginning to see more use cases of Reinforcement Learning in the wild.\nIncluding web store product recommendations, news recommendation, in the finance industry , Automated Architecture search for Machine Learning using RL ,End to End Machine Learning for Self Driving Cars, and last and most excitingly the field of Robotics where Deep Reinforcement Learning is exploding!\nWe believe that RL will start to play an ever increasing role where automated decision making is required in an end to end manner.\n\u0026nbsp;\nAdditional Learning Material For those technically inclined, or if you would like to dive deeper we have provided links to relevant chapters in Sutton \u0026amp; Bartos\u0026rsquo;s excellent text book, \u0026ldquo;Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\u0026rdquo; for each week\u0026rsquo;s material.\n\u0026nbsp;\nStarAi is Beta StarAi was entirely created by volunteer experts of their respective fields here in Sydney, Australia.\nWhilst we did our best to ensure the content is as polished as it could be, we admit bugs exist both logical and otherwise.\nIt has also been some time since StarAi was run and some of the exercise content might be out of date (tensorflow 2.0 etc). We would welcome and feedback good or bad. Potential updates to our exercises \u0026amp; codebase would also be much appreciated.\nIf you would like to provide feedback or help in any way please reach out at contact@starai.io\n\u0026nbsp;\nDisclaimer Your use of the StarAi Reinforcement Learning course acknowledges that you have read this Disclaimer.\nThe course is provided \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo; without warranty of any kind.

We then move on to discussing Bellman equations and the intuition behind them. At the end we will explore one of the Bellman equation implementations, using the Dynamic Programming approach and finish with an exercise, where you will implement state-value and action-value functions algorithms and find an optimal policy to solve the Gridworld problem.\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nLecture Slides StarAi Lecture 2 Markov Decision Processes slides\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nExercise Follow the link below to access the exercises for lecture 2:\nLecture 2 Exercise 1: Policy Evaluation Exercise\nLecture 2 Exercise 2: Policy Iteration Exercise\nLecture 2 Exercise 3: Value Iteration Exercise\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nExercise Solutions Follow the link below to access the exercise solutions for lecture 2:\nExercise Solutions 1: Policy Evaluation\nExercise Solutions: Value Iteration\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nAdditional Learning Material  Sutton \u0026amp; Barto\u0026rsquo;s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - All of Chapter 3 \u0026amp; 4.  \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\n","date":1554296400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554296400,"objectID":"2b2a3ae8e7b1eff9bd8a6396a33c5bc6","permalink":"https://starai-course.github.io/course/lecture2/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/course/lecture2/","section":"course","summary":"Video  \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nDescription Disclaimer: This is the most mathematical lecture out of the StarAi series.

for Artificial Intelligence due to several properties of the game including very high state \u0026amp; action spaces, partial observability \u0026amp; multi agent gameplay.\nThis year Deepmind made significant progress with regards to solving the game. For all intents and purposes, removing the \u0026ldquo;human limitations\u0026rdquo; restrictions currently emposed on Deepmind\u0026rsquo;s system, the game can be said to be solved and am sure we will see even further progress towards the end of the year from Deepmind\u0026rsquo;s Starcraft team akin to AlphaGo Zero.\nWhy even release the course then? We still believe that the development of bots for games is a fun a way to learn advanced machine learning techniques \u0026amp; if your work in the field eventually leads to new breakthroughs, even more kudos to you!\nWe also believe that RL will have massive impact in the real world in end to end machine learning problems.\nFor those of you only interested in the Starcraft element of StarAi please refer to the content of week 6 by clicking this link.\n","date":1483189200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483189200,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://starai-course.github.io/about/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Way back in April 2018! -an actual epoch in the machine learning world!- we set out to create this course to help speed up the development of advanced machine learning techniques through a fun platform - mainly - Starcraft 2, hence the name \u0026ldquo;StarAi\u0026rdquo;.\nFor a long time Starcraft has been considered within the machine learning community to be the next \u0026ldquo;Grand Challenge\u0026rdquo; for Artificial Intelligence due to several properties of the game including very high state \u0026amp; action spaces, partial observability \u0026amp; multi agent gameplay.","tags":null,"title":"About.","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" StarAi is a team of Developers, Machine Learning Engineers \u0026amp; Researchers based in Australia. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nInstructor Team:\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nMachine Learning Engineer Paul Conyngham\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nReinforcement Learning PhD Candidate Alex Long\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nSoftware Engineer William Xu\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nSoftware Engineer Artem Golubev\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nArtificial Intelligence Engineer Steven Brown\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nTeaching Assistants:\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nMachine Learning Engineer Ben Jelliffe\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nDeveloper Team:\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nLow Level Software Engineer Franklin He\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nVideo Editing Team:\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nVideo Editor \u0026amp; ITS Engineer Miguel Costa\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nVideo Editor Michael DiMola III\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n","date":1483189200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483189200,"objectID":"3bf44c81f2a197de01edde90bcd77783","permalink":"https://starai-course.github.io/team/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/team/","section":"","summary":"StarAi is a team of Developers, Machine Learning Engineers \u0026amp; Researchers based in Australia. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nInstructor Team:\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nMachine Learning Engineer Paul Conyngham\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nReinforcement Learning PhD Candidate Alex Long\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nSoftware Engineer William Xu\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nSoftware Engineer Artem Golubev\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nArtificial Intelligence Engineer Steven Brown\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nTeaching Assistants:\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\nMachine Learning Engineer Ben Jelliffe","tags":null,"title":"Team","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" We would like to accelerate the progress of Reinforcement Learning research.
